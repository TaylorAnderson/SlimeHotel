Throwing a baddie into a baddie should kill both
Donâ€™t instantly lose when you get hit (instant loss if baby slime is hit is OK)
When you throw a slime into a slime for a combination, a pop kills any knight or wizard spell about to hit it, saving the slime
Maybe add objects to throw around?
Body block wizard spells and maybe sword hits?
Auto-merging slimes who walk into each other?
Buff movement speed or add a dash so you can get from the bottom to the top without losing a slime if you play perfectly
Happy slime face and heart on combination
